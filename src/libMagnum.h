/**

	Magnum -- C implementation of Mustache logic-less templates

	@file libMagnum.h

    @brief Combine a source template using the Mustache syntax and JSON data
	in order to generate a finished text string.

	Often used to generate HTML, but can be used to generate anything,
	including source code.


	See <http://mustache.github.io/> for more information.


	See <https://github.com/mustache/spec> for the formal spec.
